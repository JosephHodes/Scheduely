# Scheduley
Scheduley is a seven-day calendar that is still a work in progress. There are some minor features I still have to add for an entirely functional site. I have to re-implement the design because I focused on making the design in Figma, then coding the backend then implementing the actual design. The customization would be the last thing I implement.

# The Figma file can be found here

# What is this application for?
This application allows neurodivergent users to create an easy and straightforward interface that they can customize based on colors. And since it's so straightforward, it's a single-page application once you get past authentication.


# Research I did

# Where is it going to be hosted?
On my new server of course!
